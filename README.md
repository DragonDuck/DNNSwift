This package was aimed to make tensorflow easier to use back when it was in version 0.something-or-another. It's a pretty neat package, no question, but it's hopelessly outdated and does nothing that Keras can't do as well. The only advantage this package offers, implementing and training a DNN in three lines of code and a layout configuration file, comes at the cost of having your training data in a very specific format.

What I'm saying is, the code is here as part of my "portfolio" but you should not use this. It's not worth it.
